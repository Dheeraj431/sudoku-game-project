Sudoku Game Project
Welcome to the Sudoku game project! This is a web application implementation of the classic Sudoku game, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows users to play Sudoku puzzles, generate new ones, and solve puzzles automatically.

Getting Started
To get started with the Sudoku game, you need to have a web browser installed on your computer. You can use any modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

To run the Sudoku game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking on the file or right-clicking on the file and selecting "Open with" and choosing your web browser.

Playing the Game
To play the Sudoku game, simply click on any empty cell in the game board and enter a number between 1 and 9. The game will automatically check if the number is valid or not. If the number is valid, it will be added to the game board. If the number is invalid, the game will display an error message and the cell will remain empty.

To solve the Sudoku puzzle automatically, click on the "Solve" button. The game will use a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to the puzzle.

To generate a new Sudoku puzzle, click on the "New Game" button. The game will generate a new puzzle with a unique solution.

Customization
The Sudoku game is fully customizable. You can change  the number of initial clues, and the difficulty level of the puzzles.
